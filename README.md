# Text Transformer

[NOTE: the README is still in the process of being rewritten from the original,
and may not accurately reflect the latest changes.]

A powerful AI writing assistant, transforming selected text using both Default
and Custom prompts. Individual changes can be accepted or rejected directly in
the editor, similar to the suggested changes feature in word processing apps.
Fully keyboard driven.

Initially forked from
[Obsidian Proofreader](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-proofreader)
by Christopher Grieser, Text Transformer is now developing to be a feature complete
AI writing assistant.

## Features

- Send selected text to the AI and let it transform it. You can review, accept, or
reject each suggestion individually (using hotkeys), or in batch, making it easy
to maintain control over your document's content and quality.
- Suggested changes are inserted directly into the text: Additions as `==highlights==`
and removals as `~~strikethroughs~~`.
- Customizable and feature rich. Create your own custom prompts!
- This process streamlines editing, allowing you to quickly address grammar, style,
structure, and clarity issues directly within your workflow.
- The inline system is deeply integrated: you simply press the Hotkey to open the
  command palette, where you can issue AI-powered writing commands such as:
  * Improve, Shorten, Lengthen
  * Fix grammar, syntax and punctuation
  * Simplify language
  * Enhance readability
  * Refine Structure
  * Any custom command you've created
  * Translate to any language

Estimated pricing for the [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)
in April 2025. The plugin developer is not responsible if the actual costs differ.
You can track your usage costs [on this page](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin requires an **OpenAI API key** and incurs costs at OpenAI based on
> usage. Network requests are made when running the proofreading command.
> Planning on adding support for other LLMs in the future.

## Installation & setup

### Plugin installation
[Install in Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=text-transformer)

### Get an OpenAI API key
1. [Create an OpenAI account](https://auth.openai.com/create-account).
2. Go to [this site](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and click `Create
   new secret key`.
3. Copy the API key.
4. In Obsidian, go to `Settings â†’ Text Transformer` and paste your API key there.

> [!TIP]
> The usage costs should not be very high, nonetheless you can track them
> [on this page](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

## Usage
1. Use the command `Proofread selection/paragraph`. This will open a dropdown menu
from which you can select any of the prompts. Select the one you want to be applied
to the selected text. If there is no selection, the command will check the current
paragraph.
	* Alternatively, you can also check the whole document with `Proofread full document`.
	However, note that the quality of AI suggestions tends to decrease when
	proofreading too much text at once.
2. The changes are automatically inserted.
3. Accept/reject changes with the `Accept suggestions in selection/paragraph` command.
Same as the proofreading command, the `accept` and `reject` commands affect the
current paragraph if there is no selection. Alternatively, you can also only
accept/reject the next suggestion after your cursor via `Accept next suggestion`.

## Visual appearance of the changes
You can add the following CSS snippet to make highlights and strikethroughs
appear like suggested changes, similar to the screenshot further above. ([How
to add CSS snippets.](https://help.obsidian.md/snippets))

```css
.cm-strikethrough {
    text-decoration: none !important; /* Removes the strikethrough line */
    background-color: var(--color-red) !important;
    border-radius: 3px !important;            /* Adds slightly rounded corners */
    /* Optional: change text color for better contrast: */
    color: white !important;
}

.cm-s-obsidian span.cm-highlight {
	background-color: rgba(var(--color-green-rgb), 35%);
	border-radius: 3px !important;
	color: white !important;
}
```

## Testimonials

> I was paying $29 a month for type.ai until today, your plugin made me cancel
> the subscription, because the only feature I wanted from there was this
> granular diffing which no other app offered, until Proofreader.

## Plugin development

```bash
just init   # run once after cloning

just format # run all formatters
just build  # builds the plugin
just check  # runs the pre-commit hook (without committing)
```

> [!NOTE]
> This repo uses a pre-commit hook, which prevents commits that do not build
> or do not pass the checks.
