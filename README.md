[^1]: Estimated pricing for the [GPT 4.1 nano
	model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/) in April 2025. The plugin
	developer is not responsible if the actual costs differ. You can track your
	usage costs [on this page](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin requires an **OpenAI API key** and incurs costs at OpenAI based on
> usage. Network requests are made when running the proofreading command. (PRs
> [adding support for other LLMs](#adding-support-for-new-llms) are welcome.)

## Installation & setup

### Plugin installation
[Install in Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=proofreader)

### Get an OpenAI API key
1. [Create an OpenAI account](https://auth.openai.com/create-account).
2. Go to [this site](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and click `Create
   new secret key`.
3. Copy the API key.
4. In Obsidian, go to `Settings → Proofreader` and paste your API key there.

> [!TIP]
> The usage costs should not be very high, nonetheless you can track them
> [on this page](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

## Usage
1. Use the command `Proofread selection/paragraph` to check the selected
   text. If there is no selection, the command will check the current paragraph.
	* Alternatively, you can also check the whole document with `Proofread full
	  document`. However, note that the quality of AI suggestions tends to
	  decrease when proofreading too much text at once.
2. The changes are automatically inserted.
3. Accept/reject changes with `Accept suggestions in selection/paragraph`
   and `Reject suggestions in selection/paragraph`.  
   Same as the proofreading command, the `accept` and `reject` commands affect
   the current paragraph if there is no selection. Alternatively, you can also
   only accept/reject the next suggestion after your cursor via `Accept next
   suggestion` and `Reject next suggestion`.

## Visual appearance of the changes
You can add the following CSS snippet to make highlights and strikethroughs
appear like suggested changes, similar to the screenshot further above.
([Manual: How to add CSS snippets.](https://help.obsidian.md/snippets))

```css
.cm-strikethrough {
	text-decoration-color: var(--color-red);
}

.cm-s-obsidian span.cm-highlight {
	background-color: rgba(var(--color-green-rgb), 35%);
}
```

## Testimonials

> I was paying $29 a month for type.ai until today, your plugin made me cancel
> the subscription, because the only feature I wanted from there was this inline
> granular diffing which no other app offered, until Proofreader.

## Plugin development

### General

```bash
just init   # run once after cloning

just format # run all formatters
just build  # builds the plugin
just check  # runs the pre-commit hook (without committing)
```

> [!NOTE]
> This repo uses a pre-commit hook, which prevents commits that do not build or
> do not pass the checks.

### Adding support for new LLMs
1. Create a new adapter for the LLM in
   [./src/providers/](./src/providers/). This should take ~50 lines of code.
2. In [./src/providers/model-info.ts](./src/providers/model-info.ts), add the
   adapter function to `PROVIDER_ADAPTER_MAP`, and add models for the new
   provider to `MODEL_SPECS`.
3. In [./src/settings.ts], add a setting for the API key to
   `ProofreaderSettingsMenu` and add a field to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.

## About the developer
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
